## 🔴 STILL NEEDS NEW IMAGES

These require actual photography or proper stock images:

### Critical (Reputation Damage)
1. **Collectors Section** (`uses-collectors.png`)
   - Current: AI-generated fake Pokémon cards with gibberish text
   - Need: Real trading cards, comics, or collectibles in protective sleeves/binders
   - Impact: HIGH - Anyone who collects will spot this as fake immediately

2. **Problem Section** (`problem-image.png`)
   - Current: Linen closet with blankets and socks
   - Copy says: "Sticky gunk on thread spools, torn edges on vintage cards, brown residue on gift wrap"
   - Need: Image showing actual tape damage on thread spools, cards, and gift wrap
   - Impact: HIGH - Complete mismatch between image and copy

3. **Travelers Section** (`uses-travelers.png`)
   - Current: Toiletry bottles with no cords visible
   - Copy mentions: "tidy cords"
   - Need: Travel bag with both toiletries AND cable management
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Copy promises something image doesn't show

### High Priority (Credibility)
4. **Product Carousel Slots 2 & 3**
   - Currently removed (were duplicates from other sections)
   - Need: 2 new unique product shots showing:
     - Tape being used/applied
     - Close-up detail shot or different angle
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Carousel feels empty with only 2 images

5. **Heat Resistant Section** (`works-heat.png`)
   - Current: Shows Starbucks-style gift cards (trademark issue)
   - Alt text now accurate, but image could be better
   - Need: Better demonstration of heat resistance
   - Impact: LOW - Alt text fixed, but image could be improved

6. **Waterproof Section** (`works-waterproof.png`)
   - Current: Dry garden hose being wrapped
   - Copy says: "Holds strong underwater"
   - Need: Image showing tape actually in/near water
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Claims underwater strength but shows dry hose

### Lower Priority (Polish)
7. **Product Width Verification**
   - Listed as "1" Width" but `product-roll-hero.png` appears to show 2+ inches
   - Action: Verify actual product width, update listing or replace image
   - Impact: LOW - Could confuse customers about actual product size

8. **Tape Color Consistency**
   - Hero image shows white/clear tape
   - All other images show yellow tape
   - Features list says "Crystal clear"
   - Brand name is "Banana Tape" (implies yellow)
   - Action: Decide if tape is yellow or clear, make all images consistent
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Brand identity confusion

## 🔵 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMAGES

### Photography Guidelines
When creating replacement images:

1. **Use real products** - No AI-generated images
2. **Match copy exactly** - If copy mentions cords, show cords
3. **Show the tape in action** - People using it, not just sitting nearby
4. **Accurate alt text** - Describe what's actually in the image
5. **Consistent tape color** - Pick yellow OR clear and stick with it
6. **Clear, well-lit shots** - Professional looking but authentic
7. **Avoid trademark issues** - No recognizable brand logos (Starbucks, Pokémon, etc.)

### Quick Wins with Stock Photos
For sections you can't photograph yourself:
- **Collectors:** Real trading card binders or comic book storage
- **Travelers:** Travel packing cubes with cables/cords organized
- **Problem:** Before/after of tape residue on various items
